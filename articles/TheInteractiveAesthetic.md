The Interactive Aesthetic
------------------------------
<p>
What is the aesthetic experience of using a computer? Interactivity, otherwise known as an advanced implementation of primal “call and response” instincts. I think a big draw of the computer to nerdish children is that once you gain a certain level of proficiency, you don’t necessarily feel “alone” with the computer. It reacts to what you do. It is both a reflection of your actions and a separate entity unto itself.</p>

The deep draw of the physical book is that it is a silent and totemic record of a person’s imaginative and/or reasoning faculties. These records sift and mingle through the reader’s mind, cultivating an intellectual relationship.  Beyond this, a reader has no interface to the story besides mulling it over internally (I liken reading an excellent book to meditation). The book, of course, can never react to thoughts like a computer reacts to code. In this sense, the aversion to e-readers among some bibliophiles smacks of a weird application of the Uncanny Valley: it looks like a book, it reads like a book, but its not a book. To them, the book is trapped in the computer, misappropriated. Why? Because even though a computer’s greatest asset is interactivity, ebooks have yet to approach that dimension in an aesthetically satisfying way.</p>

Taking notes and looking up words  are fantastic applications of textual computability, but these have no direct artistic bearing on the way the work is perceived mentally. These utilities are, like the ebook itself, digital implementations of a physical product. A dictionary and thesaurus are useful, but does even the dedicated bibliophile swoon over a concisely-defined word like they do to a great sentence in the novel? A few might. I do not.</p>

A quality ebook that uses interactivity to engage the emotional and imaginative faculties would be the herald of a revolution. The-author-as-programmer-as-artist.</p>
