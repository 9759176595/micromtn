The Interactive Aesthetic
------------------------------

<p>
The deep draw of the physical book is that it is a silent and totemic record of a person’s imaginative and/or reasoning faculties. These records sift and mingle through the reader’s mind, cultivating an intellectual relationship.  Beyond this, a reader has no interface to the story besides mulling it over internally (I liken reading an excellent book to meditation). The book, of course, can never react to thoughts like a computer reacts to code. In this sense, the aversion to e-readers among some bibliophiles smacks of a weird application of the Uncanny Valley: it looks like a book, it reads like a book, but its not a book. To them, the book is trapped in the computer, misappropriated. Why? Because even though a computer’s greatest asset is interactivity, ebooks have yet to approach that dimension in an aesthetically satisfying way.</p>

What is the aesthetic experience of using a computer? Interactivity, otherwise known as an advanced implementation of primal “call and response” instincts. It is both a reflection of your actions and a separate entity unto itself.</p>
