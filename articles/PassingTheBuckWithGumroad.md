Passing the Buck With Gumroad
-------------------------------

<p>
This past spring Sahil Lavingia launched a new online purchasing platform named <a href="http://www.gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a>. I remember reading the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2406614">initial Show Hacker News post</a> and being very excited. What attracted me to the platform was its decentralization of commerce. The creator of a digital good could now also be its distributor. It gives artists, from poets to painters, nearly first hand control on how to deliver their art. A service like Gumroad completely eliminates the need for a major publisher or other middleman in handling distribution of a product like a literary magazine, for example. Bandcamp for musicians operates on a similar principle and many musicians I know love the autonomy it offers. The neat “packaging” of a Gumroad product as a link also makes the goods more susceptible to viral promotion while maintaining a sense of intimacy between the buyer and seller. Coders could use it as a way to deliver small, but useful programs while also making money on the side. Musicians could let slip rare demos or new songs with a single link.</p>

<p>
According to the twitter acount, Gumroad is in fact <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/slavingia/status/57487490063409152"> profitable</a> and netted Sahil a tidy ROI.  However, at the risk of being anecdotal, I have yet to come across a Gumroad link in the wild. Gumroad’s discrete itemization of any digital good is too brilliant of an idea to go unheeded as a watershed for entrepreneurs and artists alike .</p>

<p>
A google search for “gumroad” returns a smattering of press releases with titles like “Why Gumroad Is The Next Billion Dollar Startup” (written only a few days after Gumroad was launched) for about two pages and then drops off into real estate. A query for “gumroad.appspot.com” (where Sahil directs product traffic for security) is better, with over five thousand results directed (mostly) to gumroad product links hawked on twitter and blogs. Yet, it becomes apparent that perhaps the biggest flaw in Gumroad is that it is a delivery platform with not much room for merchants to stand on. When a musician sells a song with a Gumroad link posted to their twitter, only those who already follow them receive the link. Thus an established base for the seller is a necessity if Gumroad wants to see more traffic, since the product links are entirely self-contained (no links or images of other products for sale). If an interested buyer wants to see a wider selection, they must either google “gumroad.appspot.com [artist / creator name]” or hope that there is a duly-updated section of previous links on the artist’s page.</p>

<p>
While profitable and gaining traction, it would appear Gumroad is not yet the barrier-smasher it could be. What etsy has done for homespun artisans, Gumroad could do for those dealing with the digital realm. Centralizing products within the Gumroad infrastructure would be a boon to independent creators.</p>
