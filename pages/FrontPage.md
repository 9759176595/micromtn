 **Why hello there**
 <br>
Howdy! How goes it?
<br>
**Nothing much, just hanging out. What about yourself?**
<br>
Keeping it real, coding, digging it. 
<br>
**Coding eh?**
<br>
No doubt! Scala, Python, and Javascript are my lingua franca.
I just finished up a <a href="http://drablab.org/imp-projects.shtml">research internship</a> and my web app has entered double-secret-incubation mode.
<br>
**Neato burrito! What else have you been up to?**
<br>
I've been chipping away at a <a href="http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=xMZgRC6t">novel</a> for the past six months in conjunction with heading the *Bard Student Reading Series*. We hold readings on campus, publish chapbooks, and print broadsides of both student and faculty work.

<br>
**Whoa! What are your future plans? ** 
<br>
Short term: Finish this web app and then start the next.
<br>
Long term: Get my CS degree from Bard College and then head on down to Silicon Alley. If you or anyone you trust, care, love, or are soulbound to, needs an inventive and inspired coder then <a href="mailto:me.anzuoni@gmail.com">drop me a line</a>.
